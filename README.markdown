Popup Statusbar
===========

Popup Statusbar is a Safari Extension that mimics the popup statusbar from Google Chrome using Javascript and CSS.. It is based upon a Greasemonkey script by [Bennett Blodinger](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/50053), but has been rewritten.

Installation
============

To install and use this extension, Safari Extensions must be enabled. To do this, go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and check "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Once the Develop menu is active, click Develop > Enable Extensions. You can then view your extensions in Safari > Preferences > Extensions.

Once Extensions are enabled, download the packaged extension [here](http://github.com/downloads/vasshaug/popupstatusbar.safariextension/popupstatusbar.safariextz).

Notes
=====

The full source is available here on Github. Fork it and do whatever you want with it.
